Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.
Python's built-in data structures - Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets - offer a rich toolkit for managing, organizing, and manipulating data in various ways. Lists provide dynamic flexibility, dictionaries enable efficient key-based access, tuples ensure immutability for constants, and sets focus on unique elements and set operations. The choice of which data structure to use depends on the specific needs of your program and the type of data you're working with, allowing you to write efficient and well-organized code.
